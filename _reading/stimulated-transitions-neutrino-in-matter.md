Stimulated transitions in matter:

1. MSW
2. Parametric resonance
3. Kneller et al resonance

However, we can show that both parametric resonance and the resonance researched by Kneller are described as Rabilike resonances.

To make it self-consistent, we will talk about

0. Neutrino oscillations in vacuum
1. How can matter modify the neutrino oscillations
2. MSW
3. Parametric resonance and Kneller's resonance
4. How to interpret as Rabi oscillations
5. Why is this important

I also have my slides for the candidacy exam.

## Vacuum oscillations

What should be included in the slides? Only a very brief introduction about the oscillations and skip the part about neutrinos.

For fun, use images from [How heavy is a neutrino?](http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/how-heavy-is-a-neutrino)


## What's special in our paper

Hamiltonian for neutrino oscillations in matter

$$
\begin{equation}
H^{(m)} =  - \frac{\omega_m}{2}\sigma_3 + \frac{1}{2} \delta \lambda(r) \cos 2\theta_m \sigma_3 - \frac{1}{2}\delta\lambda (r) \sin 2\theta_m \sigma_1.
\end{equation}
$$

For single frequency profile, we have

$$
\begin{equation}
H^{(m)}\to -\frac{\omega_m}{2} \sigma_3 - \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}
$$
