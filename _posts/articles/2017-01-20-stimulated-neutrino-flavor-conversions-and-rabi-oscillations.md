## Background

Neutrinos are light but they have mass. What we know now is that there are probably three masses, the mass difference between the first two are quite small, and the third mass is quite different from the first two. The problem is we do not know whether the third mass is heavier of lighter. If it's heavier we call it normal hierarchy, otherwise it is inverted hierarchy.

Neutrinos oscillations are in fact neutrino flavor conversions. Suppose we have a electron neutrino here. It propagates and transforms into other flavors.

We can define the probability for each flavors and plot it out vs the distance that the neutrino traveled. Here in this plot, vertical axis is the probability for each flavors. In this example, we have electron neutrino in the beginning, as it travels we have a probability of detecting other flavors. And it has a periodic shape that's why it's called neutrino oscillations.

Then why do they oscillate? We'll demonstrate it using two flavors. Three flavor neutrino oscillations are basically the same. It's just more involved in math.

In quantum mechanics, we know that a particle on one of its eigen states will remain on that state. For relativistic particles, eigen energy states are determined by masses. Suppose we have a neutrino on one of its eigen energy state or mass state, it will remain on that state. Since flavor states are different from eigen energy states, neutrinos start as electron flavor will change on its path.

In fact flavor states of neutrinos are related to eigen states of neutrinos in this way. $\theta_v$ is the called vacuum mixing angle. If $\theta_v$ equals to 0, we have no mixing.

The evolution of the states are determined by Schrodinger equation. Here the wave function has two amplitudes, one for electron flavor, one for muon flavor. $\mathbf H$ is the Hamiltonian. It is a 2 by 2 matrix. $\omega_v$ is the vacuum oscillation frequency. It's related to the energy and the masses of neutrinos. The sigmas are the Pauli matrices.

We can easily solve the Schrodinger equation and find out the change of flavors. Here and throughout this talk I provide a visualization of the system. The trick is to use Pauli matrices to rewrite Hamiltonian and wave function into three dimensional vectors.

We define a vector $\vec H$ in this way using the Pauli matrices. We also define a flavor isospin vector $\vec s$ using the wave function. $\vec s$ is a three dimensional vector that represents the state of the system. In our definition, if it's pointing upward then we have only electron flavor. If it's pointing downward, then we have only muon flavor. In between we have a mixture of electron flavor and muon flavor.

The equation of motion becomes an equation of precession. $\vec s$ is going to precess around vector $\vec H$.

Now let's apply this to the oscillation Hamiltonian, it is a vector that is tilted away from the vertical axis. Suppose we start from electron flavor. Then we have the flavor isospin vector pointing upward. Due to the precession, we will find that the state rotates into states that is a mixture of electron flavor and muon flavor. And it's periodic.
